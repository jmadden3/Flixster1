### Notes
I spent 15 hours on this project. I had to restart the project because there was a SIGBRT error that would not go away. 
At that point I was able to see the rows and the movie titles. I had trouble with the cocoa pods downloading. 
There were issues with my gif not showing properly so I hope that it is visible now.
